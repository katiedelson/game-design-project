### 2024.09.24 - 2hrs: Set up repo, itch.io, trello, and this!
* need to make new ssh key without passphrase :(

### 2024.10.05 - 4hrs: Set up test tilemap & started on wall jumping & sliding
* put together basic level with custom tileset I already had made prior
* found tutorial: and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PiMrxGP2_o which will help me with the wall jump mechanic
* ran into some problems with the is_on_wall() func as I wanted it to be true if it was
  near wall rather than actively running into, found more indepth tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CStyW2aTBSo
  which helped create separate function is_near_wall with a RayCast2D node
* having issues with smoothness & code organization, might overhaul the given script for player physics
